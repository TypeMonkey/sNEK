# sNEK 
_A statically typed , s-expression based meta language_

`snek sourceFile.snek`

### Purpose
_"JavaScript was written in ten days, I'll write sNEK in two."_

I wrote sNEK in a matter of around twelve hours to see how much complexity/features I can put into a language in a short amount of time.

Seeing that my biggest obstacles in my past PL projects was grammar, I decided that the quickest was to overcome it was by implmenting S-expressions. The rest of the lanuage kind of just *popped* in after that.

### Features
_"I just gotta finish this so it looks I actually did something for SD Hacks"_

The main attribute of sNEK is it's barebones simplicity when it comes to many programming languages. 

With only **8** basic expressions, sNEK offers quick application development and many guarentees with its static type checking.

### Requirements
sNEK is written in Java 1.8 and depends on a modified version of Grammatica 1.6 for its grammar and parsing. 

Every binary will be released with Grammatica 1.6 included, so your machine needs to only Java 8 for sNEK to run.
